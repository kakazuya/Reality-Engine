# STATE: the one live state. Keep it under 40 lines, overwrite in place. Last updated 2026-11-02 (Wolf)

## Now
**Pilot test on BAJFINANCE, HINDALCO and KEC, by Shivam's order of 2 Nov.** Workspace tickets no longer block it. The last prototype failed: 0 of 40 sampled answers right, 78% of numbers missed: `tasks/pilot60/PROTOTYPE3_CLAUDE_GRADE_2026-11-01.md`.

## Next action
1. HP job `proto3-all-pages`: OCR of all 4,167 pages. When it ends, `hp_run fetch 'C:\RE\jobs\proto3-all-pages\ocr_pages.jsonl.gz' --dest tasks/pilot60/proto3_text/ocr_pages.jsonl.gz`, replacing the 672-page file now there, then `python -m reality_engine.pilot.proto3 dryrun`.
2. T-042 worker: review and merge the rule ledger.
3. T-035: rerun extraction, hard stop $8, DeepSeek; recheck disputes; load facts; answer the same questions; grade by reading. KEC's 10 transcripts are now in `chunks_v3_pilot.db` (T-037); backup in `D:\RealityEngine\backups`.

## Running
HP job `proto3-all-pages`; T-042 worker. The dsh-worker server still has the old start gate until restarted.

## Where the project stands
Golden rule step 3, schema design, with the question bank accepted (1,901 questions, frozen). Gate on the old pilot: 12.7% contract strict, but 0 of 127 answered rows right on hand reading. Prototype on 3 companies failed its grade: `tasks/pilot60/PROTOTYPE3_CLAUDE_GRADE_2026-11-01.md`. Full record: `tasks/arch_v4/GATE_STATE_2026-11-01.md`. Decisions: `D:\RealityEngine\plans\DECISION_LOG.md`, last 5 entries.

## Never
Copy keys into files or print them. Read `D:\Shivam_Private\Manual Dumps` or send it to the HP or any model, or put amounts in the repo or decision log. Loosen a grader to raise a score. Push without Shivam's OK. Spend DeepInfra or use paid models without his OK. Change the question bank, labels or scope without his ruling. Assign pilot bank reasoning to a worker: Claude owns it, DeepSeek only reads.

## Merge recipe
Review by meaning; a report without `Docs updated:` is not merged. `git merge --no-ff --no-commit <branch>`, drop `PROGRESS_NOTES.md`, keep ours on `query/v4/__init__.py`, run the tests, update this file and each affected doc, commit ending `By: Wolf` and the co-author line. Copy `.tmp` DBs first, then remove the worktree and branch. Log to the decision log and `rclone copy D:\RealityEngine\plans gdrive:InfoDiffusion_archive/plans`. HP: `hp_worker fetch-patch <job>` gives branch `dsh-hp/<job>`.

## Machines
How to operate each computer: `machines/README.md`. All HP work runs headless. Nothing is pushed without Shivam's OK.
